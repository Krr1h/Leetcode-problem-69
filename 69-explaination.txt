Here
After taking the input from a user. 
We literally set the power of the input to 0.5.
And used floor division to round it off.
Finally converted the output to int data type as asked in the problem.


Trials - 5
Forgot:
 - // for floor division in python


Learned - It took way too trials for an easy problem just because i've never worked with python functions. Have to learn it ASAP.
